Brand collaboration between Mc-Auslan and Lucy & Yak.<br>

The joy of sharing something with friends and craving for new tastes lead Peter McAuslan<br>
to embark on a journey that has been going on for decades. There is a flavour for each season<br>
of the year and many more that should quench your thirst. Stop by for a few drinks, or just<br>
visit with friends if you plan on being a designated driver. Come get a case to take home.<br>

As for the branding, the Rainbow style represents how we plan to create as many different<br>
flavours as we can. The amount of amalgamations are endless and we wonâ€™t stop producing<br>
brews until you have a favourite for every single season. We partnered with Lucy & Yak to<br>
drive this point home. Our new flavours will change the game and inspire you to branch out<br>
and try more.<br>
